# MCU Class Projects

This repository contains my microcontroller-based projects for class.  
Each folder includes source code, circuit diagrams (if available), and documentation.

## Contents
- **STM32 Projects:** Examples using STM32CubeIDE and HAL drivers
- **Arduino Projects:** Simple sketches for Arduino boards
- **ESP32 / Others:** Networking and IoT demos

## Purpose
- Practice embedded systems programming
- Learn peripheral control (GPIO, ADC, Timers, UART, I2C, SPI)
- Build a portfolio of MCU projects for future reference
