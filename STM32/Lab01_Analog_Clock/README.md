## ðŸ•’ Lab01 - Ex6 â†’ Ex10 - Analog Clock

This project implements **an analog clock simulation** using LEDs on STM32.  
Each exercise builds upon the previous one to create a working LED-based clock.
## ðŸ“Œ Exercises Overview
# Ex6 - Test Analog Clock
Turn on every single LED in sequence.
# Ex7 - clearAllClock() 
Turn off all LED.
# Ex8 - setNumberOnClock(int num)
Turn on the "num" LED on Clock
# Ex9 - clearNumberOnClock(int num)
Turn of the "num" LED on Clock
# Ex10 - simulate the clock with hour - minute - second
Turn on 3 LEDs for hour, minute, second
